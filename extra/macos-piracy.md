# MacOS Apps

Unlike Linux, anything of any real utility, even if acquired by package manager, requires a paid license or other sort of monetary encouragement for the developer to work on the project. While this is totally reasonable, it is my poverty driving me to use this awful OS as I cannot afford a new computer and so I am left with no alternative option but pirating the software I need. 

## Cracked Applications

## Telegram Groups/Channels 
Mostly they are related to the above and repost the same content anyway, so listing those would be highly redundant honestly. Telegram groups/channels are more useful for cracked Android APKs, not so much MacOS applications.
